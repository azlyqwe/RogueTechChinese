The crew got a little competitive, way too close to one of their barns. And, uh, those machines don't stop as well as a BattleMech.

We had some damaged pieces we'd salvaged, and I thought we could improve those AgroMechs. For, uh, colony protection. But I forgot that those settlers aren't MechWarriors. By the time the machine gun ran out of ammo, it had damaged a barn, a warehouse and another AgroMech."

You keep an eye on your cards but soon you're pulled into a conversation with Yang about the rarity of functional quad 'Mechs. Darius is displeased at how lightly you're taking the game but it's not clear why until Yang notices the pile of chips he'd been absently collecting all night.

"Of course!" says Darius and smiles widely. "You see? I'm smiling. We're all smiling. You can do it too." He nods around at everybody. Yang grins, while Sumire's smile is small and crooked. As a reluctant grin quivers at the corners of Dr. Murad's mouth, you smile as well. The game starts, but play is slow and leisurely, ending long before the gathering breaks up."

Shortly after that, Darius says, "You win, Commander. This time. That was an excellent game. I'll see you in about three hours for our daily meeting."

You stretch and clap him on the back. "Just consider it advanced training in 'keeping your skills sharp.'" You toss your one remaining chip in the air and catch it again.

Dr. Murad nods. "Of course. Let me set your expectations, however. The Star League abandoned the <i>Argo</i>'s design after making only two ships of its class. This may be a defect their engineers didn't manage to solve before the project ended."

She returns seven hours and three shakier-than-usual episodes later. "I'm no closer to a fix, but I know <i>why</i> this is happening. The <i>Argo</i>'s rotation controller is disabled while the pods are folded. There are even mechanical safeties to ensure the ship doesn't tear itself apart by trying to rotate under thrust. But there's a bug in the controller software kernel that is trying to wake it up periodically. Thus, the shaking."

"But the safeties are functioning?" you ask.

migid "event_co_rumbleSeat.outcome_1_1.Options1.1.Details"
migstr "You say, "Dr. Murad, please make another effort to solve this. We would all feel better."

"I will try, Commander. However, it is clearly something deep and fundamental in the <i>Argo</i>'s design. It's likely this was an issue even when the <i>Argo</i> was newly built."

Seven hours and three shakier-than-usual episodes later, Dr. Murad is no closer to fixing the problem. "It's definitely the rotation mechanism waking up while the habitat pods are folded. The safeties are preventing it from moving, so nothing is actually happening apart from the shaking. I believe it's a fault in the software but making changes there would be incredibly dangerous."

"So, it's safer to leave it as it is?" you ask.

"Yes, Commander. It's annoying, but perfectly safe. For now.""
migid "event_co_rumbleSeat.outcome_1_2.Options1.2.Details"
migstr "You say, "Would you continue to investigate the problem, Dr. Murad?"

"As I've told you on past occasions," she begins, "there is a software defect in the habitat pod rotation controller. The pods are folded for travel, and the controller is supposed to be dormant, but it continues to count rotation cycles anyway. On the 512th cycle, it tries to rotate the pods despite them being folded. That's our 2.4 hours. It cannot actually perform the rotation because of mechanical safety measures that prevent that from happening. That's our shaking."

Sumire says, "I liked it better when it was a mystery."

Dr. Murad shakes her head. "There's nothing for me to 'fix'. I inspect the safeties for stress and wear every time we break orbit. As absurd as this issue is, the <i>Argo</i> was designed to handle it.""
migid "event_co_rumbleSeat.outcome_1_3.Options1.3.Details"
migstr ""Before you say anything, Commander," Dr. Murad forestalls you. "This is all within the <i>Argo</i>'s designed tolerances. We're looking at a minor fault in the habitat pod rotation system that causes it to attempt a rotation every so often even when the pods are folded for travel, as they are now. It can't rotate them because of mechanical safeties. Think of it like a muscle twitch in your leg when you're lying in bed."

"That <i>definitely</i> makes me feel better about this," Sumire says.

Ninety minutes later, Dr. Murad calls up from Engineering. "I've restarted the pod rotation controller, and that will quell the problem indefinitely."

"Oh, come on," {TGT_MW.Callsign} grumbles. "It's my week to lead the daily exercises! I don't want to miss that. I've got a killer routine planned. What if the MedTechs analyze this supplement and prove it's safe, Commander?""

Later that day, a MedTech visits the Command Center with a report. "Upon second examination, we found that this substance {TGT_MW.Callsign} is using contains a natural analgesic and promotes tissue repair, but it also has traces of several illicit narcotics."

You shake your head. "A narwhal speedball? No wonder {TGT_MW.SUBJ} {TGT_MW.Gender?NonBinary:are|Default:is} feeling so good."

The MedTech's brow furrows. "Uh, yes. You could call it that. More importantly, the 'natural remedy' has been confiscated, so {TGT_MW.Callsign} doesn't harm {TGT_MW.OBJ}{TGT_MW.Gender?NonBinary:selves|Default:self}. {TGT_MW.SUBJ_C}'ll remain in the MedBay until all side effects subside."

You look down the line at the red-faced MechWarriors, sweating and panting. One of the joggers groans in pain. "Are you sure you're feeling okay?"

"Better than ever! We're only on mile nine of 26." {TGT_MW.SUBJ_C} {TGT_MW.Gender?NonBinary:gulp|Default:gulps} from a bottle of milky liquid.

Later, you return to the MedBay after receiving an urgent message that {TGT_MW.Callsign} had an accident in the mess. When you arrive, {TGT_MW.DET} arm is in a full cast. You sigh. "After everything we talked about, what happened?"

"Commander, I don't know if you've gone to down there to visit, but it's kind of impressive what {TGT_MW.CALLSIGN} has managed to do with the space. It's almost… homey."

"Alright." {SCN_MW.Callsign} smiles. "I won't argue with that." You dismiss them both, before more bickering breaks out.

The next day, Darius's pulls you aside. "{TGT_MW.Callsign} stuffed {SCN_MW.Callsign}'s locker with garbage. Half-eaten food scraps spilled all over {SCN_MW.OBJ}.

{SCN_MW.Callsign} throws {SCN_MW.DET} hands up in disbelief. "So, the rules don't matter?"

"The rules help keep this outfit sane, but what you're doing is going to make everyone hate you. You're insulting the XO, me, and the rest of this crew." You gesture to {TGT_MW.Callsign}. "Do you want {TGT_MW.OBJ} to hesitate when your <i>life</i> is on the line?"

The heat in {SCN_MW.Callsign}'s cheeks dissipates. "Message received, Commander." {SCN_MW.SUBJ_C} {SCN_MW.Gender?NonBinary:turn|Default:turns} to {TGT_MW.Callsign}, placing a hand on {SCN_MW.DET} chest. "I'm sorry. Let me handle the cleaning.

{SCN_MW.Callsign} shoves {SCN_MW.DET} hands in {SCN_MW.DET} pockets, looking away. "So, I should forget the rules?"

"You should remember <i>your</i> place. Discipline is the XO's job, <i>not</i> yours."

"He should do a <i>better</i> job." {SCN_MW.Callsign} says through clenched teeth.

You shake your head. "One more word and I cancel your next paycheck." {SCN_MW.Callsign} glares, but stalks off silently.

While {SCN_MW.SUBJ} {SCN_MW.Gender?NonBinary:root|Default:roots} through a storage closet, [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] pulls you aside. "Thanks for putting your foot down, Commander. Everyone was getting tired of {SCN_MW.Callsign}'s attitude.""

The MechWarriors begrudgingly agree, though they don't look directly at one another. Noticing their reticence, you gesture for them both to step forward. "Not that long ago, you two got along just fine. What happened?"

{TGT_MW.Callsign} looks up. "I'm just tired of [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] getting all the praise from Darius."

{SCN_MW.Callsign}'s blinks in surprise. "You're <i>jealous</i>? Of <i>me</i>? I was annoyed that the rest of the MechWarriors kept going on and on about your antics. I wanted to take you down a peg."

You incline your head. "Sounds like you both have a lot to discuss and <i>plenty</i> of time."

"I won't hold back." {SCN_MW.Callsign} looks {TGT_MW.Callsign} in the eyes.

"You heard the, Commander." [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] shoves a broom at [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]]. "Get it together."

Bristling, {TGT_MW.Callsign} pushes back. "I've got nothing left to say to {SCN_MW.OBJ}. {SCN_MW.Callsign} isn't listening. {SCN_MW.SUBJ_C}{SCN_MW.Gender?NonBinary:'re|Default:'s} waiting for me to misstep so {SCN_MW.SUBJ} can report me to the XO."

"That's enough." You raise your voice and the MechWarriors shrink back. "I've got a half a mind to lock you in a storage closet until you <i>both</i> shape up." The MechWarriors grow silent, refusing to look at one another, but slowly they return to garbage detail.

When you check on them throughout the week, you can feel the hostility in their eyes, the frosty ambivalence of their brief exchanges. The MechWarriors get their work done without further incident, but the tension remains."
migid "event_mw_minorInfraction.outcome_2_2.Options2.2.Details"
migstr ""Do I look like your <i>babysitter</i>?" You fix each MechWarrior with a stern look. "Get your <i>shit</i> together and work this out like <i>adults</i> if you want to deploy any time soon."

You raise a hand to silence [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]]. "If you can't handle this petty dispute, how can I trust you on the battlefield?" You shake your head. "I don't want to hose you out of a cockpit."

The MechWarriors share a look, cheeks reddening with embarrassment now instead of anger. They both promise to work out their problems, nearly speaking up in unison.

The next day, Darius pulls you aside, eyes wide with astonishment. "Commander, the garbage cans are <i>sparkling</i>... they're downright <i>lemony</i> fresh. This is a miracle. What did you <i>say</i> to {SCN_MW.Callsign} and [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]]?"

You refrain from correcting {TGT_MW.OBJ}, taking a deep breath as you turn the corner. The argument echoes down the hall, growing louder. You catch a couple bits and pieces involving "your mother" and an "LRM." Enough to get the idea.

The next day, Darius pulls you aside, heaving a sigh. "[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] is in the MedBay. Got knocked out cold by {TGT_MW.Callsign}.

You pause for a moment, letting your words sink in. "We'll set aside a million C-Bills for a one-time bonus… to be divided equally."

You shake your head. "I don't pay you to question my decisions. My ship, my rules."

As you enter the Command Center the next day, the XO's airbrushed visage greets you on a dozen screens. Dr. Murad cover her mouth with a hand, while Sumire laughs uproariously. Doubled-over, Yang wipes a tear from the corner of his eye.

Red-faced, the XO wrestles the controls, trying to remove the images "{TGT_MW.Callsign} is going to be <i>very</i> busy polishing <i>every</i> bulkhead in the <i>Argo</i> after this stunt."

In a couple days, the crew gathers in the makeshift gallery for the reveal. Painted across the bulkheads, Yang leaps wildly, encased in blue armor. His cybernetic arm is transformed into autocannon, blasting an unseen foe.

While the crew excitedly crowds around {TGT_MW.OBJ}, Darius sidles up next you. "I hate to say it, but I kind of wish we'd kept my mural." He crosses his arms and you realize the XO is wearing a sleeveless vest for the first time.

Later in the day, you receive an urgent message from Darius. {TGT_MW.Callsign} collapsed on the floor spasming in pain during daily training. The MedTechs operated immediately.

You rush back to the MedBay and visit {TGT_MW.OBJ} in a recovery room. {TGT_MW.DET_C} eyes flutter open and settle into a glare. You keep a respectful distance. "I'm sorry, {TGT_MW.Callsign}. I should have trusted your instincts."

"Thank you, Commander." {TGT_MW.Callsign} nods eagerly. "You won't regret this, I promise."

Two weeks later, you're jolted awake by the scream of klaxons. The comms buzz with the XO's voice. "We've got an oxygen leak. Sensors say that something's attacking the ventral airlock—from the outside."

Cursing, you pull on your uniform. "Some people never learn, do they, Darius?"

"Put the fear of god into {TGT_MW.OBJ}." You collapse back into your bunk. "And Darius? Tell {TGT_MW.OBJ} that if this ever happens again, we'll just let {TGT_MW.OBJ} stay out there. The <i>Argo</i> could use a new hood ornament.""

{TGT_MW.SUBJ_C} {TGT_MW.Gender?NonBinary:redden|Default:reddens}. "I know I was reckless. I was overwhelmed by nostalgia—I grew up in low gravity—we'd go out on 'star walks' nearly every day. That's no excuse though."

"Exactly. If you can't control yourself here, how am I supposed to trust you in a 'Mech?"

{TGT_MW.Callsign} meets your gaze. "I'll tell you how I did it. Every hatch on this ship is connected to an actuator. If you know where to look—it only takes about eight pounds of pressure to force it open. Cover the panelling with some spot welding and it'll be secure."

"And yet, here I am, alive and kicking." {TGT_MW.SUBJ_C} fixes you with an irritated stare. "It's almost as if I know what I'm doing, Commander."

Darius snaps. "Watch your tone, MechWarrior. Remember who you're talking to."

{TGT_MW.Callsign} blinks, and all at once, {TGT_MW.OBJ} composure cracks. A wave of self-doubt washes over {TGT_MW.OBJ} face. "I'm sorry, Commander. That was out of line."

"Damn right. I can't afford to remove you from active duty, but for the next month, you're gonna sleep in this box we're calling a brig." You pause and let the message sink in. "Now.

After {TGT_MW.SUBJ} {TGT_MW.Gender?NonBinary:agree|Default:agrees} to your terms, you suit up and meet in the airlock. The outer hatch opens and {TGT_MW.Callsign} glides into the twinkling darkness. Tethered, you follow {TGT_MW.OBJ}.

Spinning slowly, {TGT_MW.Callsign}'s faceplate reflects a swirling nebula of blue and gold. {TGT_MW.DET} voice comes over internal comms. "Out here, you're just a tiny speck of sentient dust in an endless sea of stars. It's a relief, in a way, to be reminded of your own insignificance."
