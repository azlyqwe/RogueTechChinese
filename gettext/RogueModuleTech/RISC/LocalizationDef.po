migstr "With the advanced properties and increased robustness of the Superheavy structure, the posibility arose to create an even lighter engine than thought possible before. Although this allows for larger engine cores to be used with Superheavy 'Mechs, the very high costs, increased side torso exposure and the not inconsiderable chance to start a nuclear chain reaction upon any damage taken are very obvious drawbacks. On top of this the specialized structure of the Ultralight engine also leads to considerably increased heat generation for the whole 'Mech. However, the Republic Institute for Strategic Combat did decide to develop the technology enough that it has been used in a few of their 'Mech designs."

migstr "The Tight Stream Electro Magnetic Pulse Cannon is a directed energy weapon based on the Taser system, but doesn't require the cabling and capacitors. The unit mounting the TSEMP Cannon suffers from sensor and electronic system interference every time it fires the TSEMP. The capacitors used to charge the Cannon also require time to recharge between shots, so an operator will have to wait ten seconds between shots."
