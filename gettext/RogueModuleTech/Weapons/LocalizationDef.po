Developed to fill the need for a dual-purpose weapon capable of both powerful direct fire as well as anti-air fire, the LB 10-X-P utilizes two different ammunition types: traditional armor-piercing shells as well as flechette shells that proved as equally capable in anti-air roles as in anti-armor and anti-personnel roles. The SLDF debuted the prototype autocannon in time to participate in the final battles in both the Rim Worlds Republic and the Taurian Concordat, while those two nations fielded only a relative handful of prototypes before the end of the war."
