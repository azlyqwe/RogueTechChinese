To maximize the damage generated by a ProtoMech's physical attack, Glenneth wove a series of compound capacitors through the armor. These capacitors draw power from the ProtoMech's fusion engine, storing an electrical charge. When a ProtoMech with EDP armor performs a physical attack the capacitors discharge and subject the target to a taser-like effect."
