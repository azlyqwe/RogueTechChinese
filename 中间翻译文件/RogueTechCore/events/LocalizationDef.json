For, uh, colony protection. But I forgot that those settlers aren't MechWarriors. By the time the machine gun ran out of ammo, it had damaged a barn, a warehouse and another AgroMech.\"\r\n\r\n\"Damaged?\" Darius interjects.  \"They need to completely rebuild the barn and warehouse.\"\r\n\r\nYou sigh. \"Let me know the final price of this escapade, Darius.\" You then turn back to Yang, \"Really, Yang, Wolves?\"",

            "content": "You'd been gathering supplies planetside, but have spent the last hour trying to find Yang. The sound of cheers and pounding metal draws you to the edge of town, where a pair of haphazardly repaired industrial 'Mechs beat on each other.\r\n\r\nYang calls you over. \"Sorry I wandered off, Boss. I heard a guy in the market bragging about this AgroMech fight club. I had to see it for myself.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the 'Mechs is in notably better condition than the other, but the second clearly has the better -- or possibly drunker -- pilot. The shinier 'Mech finally falls, and a small group of winning bettors collects from the bookie.\r\n\r\nYang gestures to the junkier 'Mech as the cockpit opens. \"You have to meet this pilot. He said 'any AgroMech can be made combat ready, if you’re not afraid of the challenge.' What do you say, shall we buy the victor a drink?\"",

It's usually the senior staff he ropes into playing, although occasionally some other 'lucky' crew member or guest is invited to the table. But you're the boss. He can't make <i>you</i> play.",
